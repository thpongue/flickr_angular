The task is to consume a public JSON API Feed: https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=potato&tagmode=all&format=json
(documentation: https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/) 
and display the resulting data according to these annotated wireframes.

It should only take a few hours and there's no deadline. You won't be judged on the completion time, so there's no rush, just let us know once it's completed.

    The website should function as a one-page app
    Layout should match the provided wireframes
    Look and feel is up to you, flat colours for borders and background are all that's expected
    Supports the same set of browsers as Google Apps (supported browsers list)
    Site should use responsive techniques to ensure it works on a range of devices
    Must be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (SCSS or Less are encouraged)
    We strongly encourage the use of either AngularJS or Backbone.js for your module/application
    Use any 3rd party libs you like (as long as they have a weak copyleft license)

We understand your time is precious, but if you do feel like going that extra mile then we've included a few optional enhancements below which you might like to consider. Or perhaps you may want to simply spec out one or two of these features for us, rather than actually implementing them.

    Search items e.g. a free-text search box where text entered is matched against tags
    Infinite scrolling or "Load more" style pagination
    Google +1 button for results
    Build process for generating production-ready code
    Tests (unit tests, e2e tests, etc)

Also, feel free to include any other features that you think the app could benefit from.

We'd like to see how you write code so try to keep it simple, but don't be afraid to add some flair to show off what you can do. Ideally you would upload your repository (to GitHub or similar) so that we can have a poke around.

We're looking forward to seeing what you produce! Thanks for your time.
