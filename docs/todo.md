- [x] split this into artifacts and todo - deliverables should be something I can generate from the code. Deliverables are nouns, todo's are verbs
- [x] do through john papa style guide and implement as much as possible
- [x] import ng-route
- [x] update gulp file to copy it into our build dir
- [x] update html to pull in ng-route
- [x] link to detail view
- [x] tell gulp to ignore my spec files (they're being added to app.js)
- [x] pass index from route to detail view
- [x] remove protractor-http-mock - change use from integration to pure e2e smoke test
- [x] change e2e layout so that its not functional (by page) but a set of scenario's that together give us a good smoke test for the app
- [] add integration tests
- [] rename list view service to flickr data service (since the data is shared by all views)
- [] be able to swap out the start of the url so I can integration test pointing to a local json file
- [] list_view_service provides data for the whole app (and is a singleton which means even if it doesn't, it can) so rename to flickr_data
- [] name my beforeEach functions to describe what they're up to
- [] make url private
- [] load the image
- [] update protractor tests to support (https://support.google.com/a/answer/33864)
	- [] chrome
	- [] firefox
	- [] internet explorer
	- [] safari	
- [] responsive
- [] sass
- [] search
- [] infinite load / pagination / some way of dealing with lots of content
- [] css and general beautification
- [] brainstorm other ideas
- [] start using given when then comments in my tests
- [] run integration tests in jasmine within watch but run in a browser on request (maybe multiple browsers?)
- [] build
	- [] look into a better way of managing task dependencies
		- [] use run-sequence
	- [] gulp clean is deprecated but the recommended gulp-del doesn't work with our handy gulp-load-plugins. Find an alternative
	- [] gulp-angular-protractor doesn't work with gulp-load-plugins
	- [] gulp prod needed - currently only have a local build which includes the map files
	- [] our integration task isn't clever enough to move on if the server is already running
	- [] look into headless integration testing
	- [] output integration test results to file (and .gitignore it)
	- [] watch is exiting on js errors
	- [] implement ng-annotate
	- [] evaluate sinon for test doubles (recommended by JP)
	- [] test FlickrData
	- [] implement jshint (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y230)
	- [] implement an options file (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y235)
	- [] implement file snippets (missing from the JP docs but something like this: https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y250)
	- [] try https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel
	- [] can I automate the declaration of modules? (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y400)
	- [] how to debug my unit tests?
		- [] I can output to chrome but it closes instantly upon completion
	- [] my unit tests are brittle (I'm faking up an http object) - consider alternative approaches
	- [] update integration tests with different stories
		- [] make the first one just a happy path in order to encourage progress
			- [] hence we see the progress indicator then data, rather than progress indicator then failure
		- [] note that protractor allows us to swap out modules - use this to mess up API call when testing failure
		- [] work out if the beforeEach of a nested describe is used instead of or as well as its parent beforeEach
