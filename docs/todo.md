		- [] how to debug my unit tests?
			- [] I can output to chrome but it closes instantly upon completion
		- [] split this into deliverables and todo - deliverables should be something I can generate from the code. Deliverables are nouns, todo's are verbs
			- [] consider artifacts rather than deliverables?
		- [] work out if I can remove my http stuff from the unit test and rely on integration tests
		- [] update integration tests with different stories
			- [] make the first one just a happy path in order to encourage progress
				- [] hence we see the progress indicator then data, rather than progress indicator then failure
			- [] note that protractor allows us to swap out modules - use this to mess up API call when testing failure
		- [] display a loading indicator
		- [] my unit tests are brittle (I'm faking up an http object) - consider alternative approaches
		- [] name my beforeEach functions to describe what they're up to
		- [] make url private
		- [] load the image
		- [] link to detail view
	- [] detail view
		- [] call the flickr API and display a list of results as text
			- [] photo title
			- [] photo author
			- [] publish date
			- [] photo url
			- [] tags
			- [] detail text
		- [] load the image
		- [] link back to list view
	- [] backlog
		- [] update protractor tests to support (https://support.google.com/a/answer/33864)
			- [] chrome
			- [] firefox
			- [] internet explorer
			- [] safari	
		- [] responsive
		- [] sass
		- [] search
		- [] infinite load / pagination / some way of dealing with lots of content
		- [] css and general beautification
		- [] brainstorm other ideas
		- [] admin
			- [] go through the Todd Moto style guide to ensure it complies
			- [] should my js files be in camelCase?
			- [] start using given when then comments in my tests
		- [] run integration tests in jasmine within watch but run in a browser on request (maybe multiple browsers?)
		- [] build
			- [] look into a better way of managing task dependencies
				- [] use run-sequence
			- [] gulp clean is deprecated but the recommended gulp-del doesn't work with our handy gulp-load-plugins. Find an alternative
			- [] gulp-angular-protractor doesn't work with gulp-load-plugins
			- [] gulp prod needed - currently only have a local build which includes the map files
			- [] our integration task isn't clever enough to move on if the server is already running
			- [] look into headless integration testing
			- [] output integration test results to file (and .gitignore it)
			- [] watch is exiting on js errors
			- [] implement ng-annotate
			- [] evaluate sinon for test doubles (recommended by JP)
			- [] test FlickrData
			- [] implement jshint (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y230)
			- [] implement an options file (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y235)
			- [] implement file snippets (missing from the JP docs but something like this: https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y250)
			- [] try https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel
			- [] can I automate the declaration of modules? (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y400)
