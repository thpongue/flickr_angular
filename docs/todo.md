- [] initial project setup
	- [x] create github repo
	- [x] setup gulp tasks
		- [x] basic stuff: clean, copy, watch, etc
		- [x] integration tests (gulp-angular-protractor [with built in web driver start/stop])
		- [x] gulp server
		- [x] make gulp server a prerequisite of our integration tests
		- [x] unit tests (jasmine)
		- [x] watch should invoke the server
		- [] output integration test results to file (and .gitignore it)
		- [] watch is exiting on js errors
- [] list view
	- [] call the flickr API and display a list of results as text
		- [] photo url
		- [] post title
		- [] post author
		- [] publish data
		- [] link to flickr
	- [] load the image
	- [] link to detail view
- [] detail view
	- [] call the flickr API and display a list of results as text
		- [] photo title
		- [] photo author
		- [] publish date
		- [] photo url
		- [] tags
		- [] detail text
	- [] load the image
	- [] link back to list view
- [] backlog
	- [] update protractor tests to support (https://support.google.com/a/answer/33864)
		- [] chrome
		- [] firefox
		- [] internet explorer
		- [] safari	
	- [] responsive
	- [] sass
	- [] search
	- [] infinite load / pagination / some way of dealing with lots of content
	- [] css and general beautification
	- [] brainstorm other ideas
- [] tech debt
	- [] build
		- [] look into a better way of managing task dependencies
			- [] use run-sequence
		- [] gulp clean is deprecated but the recommended gulp-del doesn't work with our handy gulp-load-plugins. Find an alternative
		- [] gulp-angular-protractor doesn't work with gulp-load-plugins
		- [] gulp prod needed - currently only have a local build which includes the map files
		- [] our integration task isn't clever enough to move on if the server is already running
