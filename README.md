This is a task set for me by a London agency called Potato when I mentioned that my github account needed a little more content. Its a good opportunity to brush up on my npm, gulp, protractor, jasmine, javascript, html and css so I'm leaving it here for anyone to see. As you may have gathered I'm looking for work so please get in touch with anything interesting :-)
